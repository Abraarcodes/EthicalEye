# Ethical Eye - Dark Patterns Detection Extension

The **Ethical Eye** project is a browser extension designed to detect dark patterns on e-commerce websites and inform users of deceptive design tactics aimed at manipulating their behavior. Dark patterns, such as false urgency, social proof, and forced account creation, often lead users into making unintended decisions, such as purchasing unnecessary items, revealing personal data, or subscribing to unwanted services. Ethical Eye uses machine learning techniques, specifically a BERT-based model, to analyze the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements of a webpage to identify these manipulative design patterns.

The extension scrapes the webpage's DOM elements, isolates textual content, and sends this data to a backend server. The backend processes the data using a pre-trained BERT model that classifies various types of dark patterns. The identified patterns are then highlighted in real-time on the webpage, offering transparency to the user regarding potentially deceptive content.

Ethical Eyeâ€™s detection system focuses on patterns like false urgency, misleading product information, hidden costs, subscription trickery, and more. With an accuracy rate of 98.2%, the tool empowers users to make more informed decisions and avoid falling victim to manipulative design. Ethical Eye is a proactive approach toward encouraging transparency and ethical behavior in e-commerce platforms.
